How to use the IOC Scanner v1.0



This version of the scanner: 

- Doesn't support raw logs, but only extracted artifacts (IP addresses, Hashes, Domains etc.)

- The known IOC file should be a list of the indicators (mentioned above).

- The matched findings are printed in the CLI, the unmatched are sent to the output file.


In the directory where the script is stored type:

'python ./IOC Scanner 1.0.py --log <pathway to the the logs file> --iocs <pathway to the iocs file> --out <pathway to the output file>'
